put any thought of testing in this file.

time cache:
    cache:
        properly remove entry after timeout
        entry exists before timeout
        get entry -> elapsed time doesn't change
        update entry -> time reset
    switch:
        initial traffic: flood
        response before timeout: send to one port
        response after timeout: flood
        topology change: request with existing src from different port: update elapsed time
        response before update timeout: send to one port
        response after update timeout: flood

lru cache:
    cache:
        all entries exist before table's full
        properly remove LRU entry after table's full
        get: update freshness
        incoming src-port mapping:
            changed: update freshness
            didn't change: don't update freshness
    switch:
        initial traffic: flood
        response before kickLRU: send to port
        incoming src-dev mapping should be after dst mapping (set(src), then get(dst))
            sample:
            (h1,h4), (h2,h1), (h3,h1), (h4,h1), (h5,h1), (h6.h7), (h4,h5)
            [h1]->[h1,h2]->[h1,h3,h2]->[h1,h4,h3,h2]->[h1,h5,h4,h3,h2]->[h6,h1,h5,h4,h3]->[h5,h6,h1,h4,h3]
        after kicked as LRU, flood
        topology change: request with existing src from different port: update freshness
